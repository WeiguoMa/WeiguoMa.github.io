I am presently a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Heng Fan][heng-fan] and [Kai Xu][kai-xu].

At this juncture, I am actively exploring my research interests, and while I think I am not gifted at all. My potential academic pursuits revolve around Quantum Information Dynamics, Quantum Computation employing Tensor Network methodologies, and their synergistic integration with deep learning techniques.

I identify as an emotional individual, and while I recognize the significance of achieving positive outcomes, I often prioritize my personal feelings in the process. Consequently, I am currently focused on cultivating a diverse range of life and research experiences that cater to my emotional needs and aspirations.
