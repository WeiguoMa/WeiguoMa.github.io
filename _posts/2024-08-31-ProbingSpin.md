abstract: >
  Characterizing the nature of hydrodynamical transport properties in quantum dynamics provides valuable insights into
  the fundamental understanding of exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter. Experimentally simulating infinite-temperature
  transport on large-scale complex quantum systems is of considerable interest. Here, using a controllable and coherent
  superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally realize the analog quantum circuit, which can efficiently prepare
  the Haar-random states, and probe spin transport at infinite temperature. We observe diffusive spin transport during
  the unitary evolution of the ladder-type quantum simulator with ergodic dynamics. Moreover, we explore the transport
  properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous
  subdiffusion in accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a scalable method of probing
  infinite-temperature spin transport on analog quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing
  out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.
