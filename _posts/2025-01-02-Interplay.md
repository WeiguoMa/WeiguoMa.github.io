abstract: >
  Topological phases are robust against weak perturbations, but break down when disorder becomes sufficiently strong.
  However, moderate disorder can also induce topologically nontrivial phases. Thouless pumping, as a $(1+1)D$ counterpart
  of the integer quantum Hall effect, is one of the simplest manifestations of topology. Here, we report experimental
  observations of the competition and interplay between Thouless pumping and disorder on a 41-qubit superconducting
  quantum processor. We improve a Floquet engineering technique to realize cycles of adiabatic pumping by simultaneously
  varying the on-site potentials and the hopping couplings. We demonstrate Thouless pumping in the presence of disorder
  and show its breakdown as the strength of disorder increases. Moreover, we observe two types of topological pumping
  that are induced by on-site potential disorder and hopping disorder, respectively. In particular, an intrinsic
  topological pump that is induced by quasi-periodic hopping disorder has never been experimentally realized before.
  Our highly controllable system provides a valuable quantum simulating platform for studying various aspects of
  topological physics in the presence of disorder.
