abstract: >
  Exploiting quantum features allows for estimating external parameters with precisions well beyond the capacity of
  classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced precision. Quantum criticality has been identified as a
  resource for achieving such enhancements with respect to the probe size. However, they demand complex probe preparation
  and measurement and the achievable enhancement is ultimately restricted to narrow parameter regimes. On the other hand,
  non-equilibrium probes harness dynamics, enabling quantum-enhanced precision with respect to time over a wide range of
  parameters through simple probe initialization. Here, we unify these approaches through a Stark-Wannier localization
  platform, where competition between a linear gradient field and particle tunneling enables quantum-enhanced sensitivity
  across an extended parameter regime. The probe is implemented on a 9-qubit superconducting quantum device, in both
  single- and double-excitation subspaces, where we explore its performance in the extended phase, the critical point
  and the localized phase. Despite employing only computational-basis measurements we have been able to achieve
  near-Heisenberg-limited precision by combining outcomes at distinct evolution times. In addition, we demonstrate that
  the performance of the probe in the entire extended phase is significantly outperforming the performance in the
  localized regime. Our results highlight Stark-Wannier systems as versatile platforms for quantum sensing, where the
  combination of criticality and non-equilibrium dynamics enhances precision over a wide range of parameters without
  stringent measurement requirements.
