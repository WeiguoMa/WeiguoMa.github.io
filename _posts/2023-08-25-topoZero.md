abstract: >
  Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
  processor is attracting growing interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum processor,
  named Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent topological states. By engineering diagonal Aubry-André-Harper
  (AAH) models, we experimentally demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet engineering,
  we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never
  been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to
  capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points,
  the energy gap’s closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and
  bulk states. Our results establish a versatile hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological
  systems in the NISQ era.
