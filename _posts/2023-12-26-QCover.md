  We introduce Quafu-Qcover, an open-source cloud-based software package developed for solving combinatorial optimization
  problems using quantum simulators and hardware backends. Quafu-Qcover provides a standardized and comprehensive workflow
  that utilizes the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). It facilitates the automatic conversion of the
  original problem into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and its corresponding Ising model,
  which can be subsequently transformed into a weight graph. The core of Qcover relies on a graph decomposition-based
  classical algorithm, which efficiently derives the optimal parameters for the shallow QAOA circuit. Quafu-Qcover
  incorporates a dedicated compiler capable of translating QAOA circuits into physical quantum circuits that can be
  executed on Quafu cloud quantum computers. Compared to a general-purpose compiler, our compiler demonstrates the
  ability to generate shorter circuit depths, while also exhibiting superior speed performance. Additionally, the Qcover
  compiler has the capability to dynamically create a library of qubits coupling substructures in real-time, utilizing
  the most recent calibration data from the superconducting quantum devices. This ensures that computational tasks can
  be assigned to connected physical qubits with the highest fidelity. The Quafu-Qcover allows us to retrieve quantum
  computing sampling results using a task ID at any time, enabling asynchronous processing. Moreover, it incorporates
  modules for results preprocessing and visualization, facilitating an intuitive display of solutions for combinatorial
  optimization problems. We hope that Quafu-Qcover can serve as an instructive illustration for how to explore
  application problems on the Quafu cloud quantum computers.
