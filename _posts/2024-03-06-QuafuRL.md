abstract: >
  With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, hybrid quantum–classical machine learning has shown numerous potential
  applications at the current stage, with expectations of being achievable in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
  era. Quantum reinforcement learning, as an indispensable study, has recently demonstrated its ability to solve standard
  benchmark environments with formally provable theoretical advantages over classical counterparts. However, despite the
  progress of quantum processors and the emergence of quantum computing clouds, implementing quantum reinforcement
  learning algorithms utilizing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) on NISQ devices remains infrequent. In this work,
  we take the first step towards executing benchmark quantum reinforcement problems on real devices equipped with at
  most 136 qubits on the BAQIS Quafu quantum computing cloud. The experimental results demonstrate that the policy agents
  can successfully accomplish objectives under modified conditions in both the training and inference phases. Moreover,
  we design hardware-efficient PQC architectures in the quantum model using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and
  develop a learning algorithm that is adaptable to quantum devices. We hope that the Quafu-RL can be a guiding example
  to show how to realize machine learning tasks by taking advantage of quantum computers on the quantum cloud platform.
