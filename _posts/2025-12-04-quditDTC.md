abstract: >
  We introduce a qudit-native framework for engineering robust discrete time crystals (DTCs) by leveraging their internal
  multilevel structure. Our approach confines the periodic drive to specified on-site subspaces, creating an embedded
  kick that suppresses heating by preventing population leakage to inactive levels. We underpin DTC stability with a
  normal-form analysis that decomposes the effective dynamics into distinct components: the carrier locks the subharmonic
  frequency, neutral terms govern the slow decay and dephasing of the subharmonic response, and charged terms scatter
  spectral weight away from the locked modes. This framework's predictive power is demonstrated across various qudit
  platforms: in spin-1 chains, we enhance the stability of DTC by confining the drive to a subspace; in spin-3/2 systems,
  we show that robustness is dictated by the symmetry of the subspace partition; and in spin-2 platforms, we realize
  concurrent 2T and 3T DTCs under a unified drive. These findings establish a systematic, hardware-efficient methodology
  for designing stable and multifunctional Floquet phases of matter on modern qudit-based quantum processors.
