abstract: >
  The generation and propagation of quantum correlations are central to understanding many dynamical properties of
  quantum systems, yet their precise experimental control and characterization remain a key challenge. Here we
  experimentally study the two-particle correlation dynamics via quantum walks in superconducting Bose-Hubbard qutrit
  arrays, with tunable on-site interaction  realized by Floquet engineering. Quantum walks show the characteristic
  change from bosonic bunching to fermionic antibunching with increasing . The two-particle entanglement and quantum
  correlation dynamics, as measured by negativity and quantum discord, are investigated. We find that depending on the
  initial state, the propagation of entanglement can be strongly suppressed with increasing , while that of quantum
  discord exhibits considerably larger amplitude; or both of them appear insensitive to . Furthermore, the forms of
  entanglement are found to persist throughout particle walks for  0 and it is generally not the case when  increases.
  Our work highlights the role of interaction in shaping quantum dynamics and extends the realm of simulating correlated
  quantum systems with superconducting circuits.
