abstract: >
  Isolated interacting quantum systems generally thermalize, yet there are several examples for the breakdown of
  ergodicity, such as many-body localization and quantum scars. Recently, ergodicity breaking has been observed in
  systems subjected to linear potentials, termed Stark many-body localization. This phenomenon is closely associated
  with Hilbert-space fragmentation, characterized by a strong dependence of dynamics on initial conditions. Here, we
  explore initial-state-dependent dynamics using a ladder-type superconducting processor with up to 24 qubits, which
  enables precise control of the qubit frequency and initial-state preparation. In systems with linear potentials, we
  experimentally observe distinct nonequilibrium dynamics for initial states with the same quantum numbers and energy,
  but with varying domain-wall numbers. Accompanied by the numerical simulation for systems with larger sizes, we reveal
  that this distinction becomes increasingly pronounced as the system size grows, in contrast with weakly disordered
  interacting systems. Our results provide convincing experimental evidence of the fragmentation in Stark systems,
  enriching our understanding of the weak breakdown of ergodicity.
