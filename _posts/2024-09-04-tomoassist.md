abstract: >
  In recent years, efficient quantum circuit simulations incorporating ideal noise assumptions have relied on tensor
  network simulators, particularly leveraging the matrix product density operator (MPDO) framework. However, experiments
  on real noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices often involve complex noise profiles, encompassing uncontrollable
  elements and instrument-specific effects such as crosstalk. To address these challenges, we employ quantum process
  tomography (QPT) techniques to directly capture the operational characteristics of the experimental setup and integrate
  them into numerical simulations using MPDOs. Our QPT-assisted MPDO simulator is then applied to explore a variational approach
  for generating noisy entangled states, comparing the results with standard noise numerical simulations and demonstrations
  conducted on the Quafu cloud quantum computation platform. Additionally, we investigate noisy MaxCut problems, as well
  as the effects of crosstalk and noise truncation. Our results provide valuable insights into the impact of noise on NISQ
  devices and lay the foundation for enhanced design and assessment of quantum algorithms in complex noise environments.

<h2 class="section-title">Problem Setting</h2>

Accurately simulating noisy quantum circuits is crucial for both benchmarking near-term quantum devices
and studying noise-driven non-equilibrium phenomena, such as noise-induced phase transitions.
However, realistic quantum noise often arises from multiple intertwined sources, making it difficult
to model using idealized or phenomenological noise channels.

Existing classical simulators face fundamental limitations:
full density-matrix simulators scale exponentially with system size,
while standard matrix product state (MPS) approaches are insufficient for representing mixed quantum states
generated by noisy operations.

<h2 class="section-title">Core Idea</h2>

The key idea of this work is to bridge **experimental noise characterization** and
**tensor-network-based simulation**.

We integrate **Quantum Process Tomography (QPT)** with **Matrix Product Density Operators (MPDO)**,
allowing noisy quantum gates reconstructed from experimental data to be directly embedded into
a tensor network representation of quantum circuits.
This enables simulations that faithfully reflect device-specific noise properties,
rather than relying on simplified or assumed noise models.

<h2 class="section-title">Methodology</h2>

Each noisy quantum operation is first characterized using QPT, yielding a process matrix
or an equivalent Kraus representation.
By reshaping Kraus operators into higher-order tensors,
noisy single-qubit and two-qubit gates can be naturally incorporated into MPDO-based circuit simulations.

During circuit contraction, these noise-related indices are propagated through the tensor network
and eventually connected to the bra space, ensuring a consistent treatment of mixed states.
To control computational complexity, singular value decomposition (SVD) truncation is applied
to the MPDO bond dimensions during contraction.

<h2 class="section-title">Demonstration and Results</h2>

We apply the QPT-MPDO simulator to representative noisy quantum circuits
and compare the resulting probability distributions with experimental demonstration data.
The tomography-assisted simulations show significantly improved agreement with experimental results
compared to simulations based on standard noise models.

Furthermore, we analyze the fidelity of truncated quantum states during MPDO evolution,
demonstrating that accurate results can be obtained with moderate bond dimensions,
making the approach scalable to larger circuits.

<h2 class="section-title">Significance</h2>

This work provides a practical framework for high-fidelity noisy quantum circuit simulation
that directly incorporates experimental noise information.
By combining QPT with MPDOs, the method offers a bridge between theoretical circuit design
and realistic experimental implementations, enabling more reliable benchmarking
and analysis of NISQ-era quantum devices.

<h2 class="section-title">Outlook</h2>

Future directions include integrating the QPT-MPDO framework with
error-mitigation strategies and extending the approach to study
noise-induced phase transitions and other non-equilibrium phenomena
in large-scale noisy quantum systems.
