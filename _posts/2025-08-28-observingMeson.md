abstract: >
  Lattice gauge theories provide a non-perturbative framework for understanding confinement and hadronic physics, but
  their real-time dynamics remain challenging for classical computations. However, quantum simulators offer a promising
  alternative for exploring such dynamics beyond classical capabilities. Here, we experimentally investigate meson
  scattering using a superconducting quantum processor. Employing a digital protocol, we realize a Floquet spin chain
  equivalent to a one-dimensional Floquet $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We observe Bloch oscillations of single kinks and
  strong binding between adjacent kinks, signaling confinement and the formation of stable mesons in this Floquet system.
  Using full-system joint readout, we resolve meson populations by string length, enabling identification of meson
  scattering channels. Our results reveal the fragmentation of a long-string meson into multiple short-string mesons,
  which is also an experimental signature of string breaking. Moreover, we directly observe inelastic meson scattering,
  where two short-string mesons can merge into a longer one. Our results pave the way for studying interacting gauge
  particles and composite excitations on digital quantum simulators.
