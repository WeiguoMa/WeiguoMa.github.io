abstract: >
  Quantum simulation has emerged as a powerful framework for investigating complex many-body phenomena. A key requirement
  for emulating these dynamics is the realization of fully controllable quantum systems enabling various spin interactions.
  Yet, quantum simulators remain constrained in the types of attainable interactions. Here we demonstrate experimental
  realization of multiple microwave-engineered spin interactions in superconducting quantum circuits. By precisely
  controlling the native XY interaction and microwave drives, we achieve tunable spin Hamiltonians, including (i) XYZ
  spin models with continuously adjustable parameters, (ii) transverse-field Ising models, and (iii) Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya
  interacting systems. Our work expands the toolbox for analog-digital quantum simulation, paving the way for exploring
  a wide range of exotic quantum spin models.
