abstract: >
  Reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) is one of the key building blocks for on-chip optical networks,
  which can download the desired signals from the bus waveguide to the corresponding drop port and upload the local
  signals from the add port to the bus waveguide to achieve the signals dropping/adding between the local and the bus
  waveguide. In this letter, we propose a ROADM based on a Benes network for mode-division multiplexing systems. As a
  proof of the concept, a ROADM with three quasi-transverse electric modes (TE0-TE2) is fabricated and experimentally
  demonstrated, which can download signals from TEi (i = 0, 1, 2) mode channel in the bus waveguide to an arbitrary
  local drop port or upload local signals to TEi mode channel via an arbitrary add port. The excess loss of the
  fabricated device is less than 10.7 dB, and the crosstalk among different space or mode channels is lower than -13.7 dB.
  Finally, a 12 Gbps data transmission experiment is carried out to verify the performance of the device. The proposed
  device is reconfigurable and scalable, and thus, it is expected to be used for optical data processing in the
  mode-division multiplexing systems.
