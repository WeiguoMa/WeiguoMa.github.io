abstract: >
  Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity,
  and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave
  operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate
  protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime (|\delta|\gg g), leveraging the third-order
  nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange |001\rangle \leftrightarrow |110\rangle states.
  By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate
  fidelity exceeding 99.9%. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error
  source in multiqubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime (approximately 1 GHz).
  The protocol maintains process fidelities exceeding 98% under decoherence, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness
  to fabrication-induced parameter variations and compatibility with existing all-microwave two-qubit gate architectures.
  This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties,
  reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the
  noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.
